                        Order of the download. This is crucial. Otherwise your site may die soon.
                        The most relevant and light data must arrive first so that the user can get started.
                        The heaviest ones should probably arrive later. The advantage of this is that,
                        if the user navigates away from the page fairly quickly, then the heavy downloads
                        are avoided

                        Is it a good idea to let the user know WHAT DATA is being downloaded??

                        Have place holders which can accept returned data readily.
